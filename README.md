# Deep Learning Universtiy Assignment Solutions

These are my solutions of the homework assignments from the course 'Deep Learning in practice with python'. This includes the 5 smaller projects that were optional but in the end almost as useful in the learning process as the rest of the course. Please understand that these are some of the first codes I've written for deep learning as such they may contain errors, bad practices and techniques that are simply obsolete at this point. The aim of these projects were to learn the basics of deep learning and its frameworks in Python.

## Getting Started

The only things you'll need to run these notebooks are the imported modules and input pictures for assignment 4 and 5, otherwise they are self contained.

### The projects

Here I'll give a brief explanation of the 5 projects contained in this repository.

#### 1. Python basics
This notebook simply goes throgh the python libraries that are frequently used for data visualization. This doesn't contain anything deep learning related yet.

#### 2. XOR problem
This notebook solves the XOR problem using a simple neural netowrk written without any higher level deep learning framework. The code partly comes from the course and the assignment was to improve the original with mini batches, momentum and regularization (l1, l2).

#### 3. Temperature forecasting

#### 4. Image classification with convolutional network

#### 5. Image generation with DCGAN
